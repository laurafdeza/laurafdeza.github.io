Hi there! Welcome to my site.

My name is Laura Fernandez Arroyo.
I am a PhD candidate at Rutgers University.

My research interests include transfer on linguistic and non-linguistic skills for language processing in bilinguals.
I also like other stuff, such as figurative language.

In my free time, I like salsa dancing, reading, drawing and watching ice dancing and pair free skating.

If you would like to ask me anything about my research, share your research with me, or talk about our hobbies, there are several venues we can get in touch through:
